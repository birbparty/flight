# Flight HAL Architecture Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive architectural documentation for the Flight Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) system.

## Documents Overview

### üìê [Flight HAL Architecture Guide](flight_hal_architecture_guide.md)
**Main architectural reference** - Comprehensive guide covering design philosophy, system architecture, platform abstraction strategy, and future extensibility planning.

**Target Audience**: Architects, senior developers, platform integrators  
**Focus**: High-level design decisions, architectural patterns, and strategic guidance

**Key Sections**:
- Executive overview and architectural achievements
- Core design principles and rationale
- System architecture with visual component diagrams  
- Performance tier system and platform abstraction
- Advanced architectural patterns (resource coordination, event system)
- Future extensibility and evolution roadmap
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

### üîß [Enhanced HAL Architecture](enhanced_hal_architecture.md)
**Technical implementation reference** - Detailed technical documentation of the HAL system components, interfaces, and implementation patterns.

**Target Audience**: Implementation developers, driver writers  
**Focus**: Technical specifications, code examples, and implementation details

**Key Sections**:
- Component implementation details
- Interface specifications and usage examples
- Platform-specific optimizations
- Build integration and configuration
- Testing strategies and performance characteristics
