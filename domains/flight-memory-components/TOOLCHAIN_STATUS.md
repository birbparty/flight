# WIT Toolchain Setup Status

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Scripts Created
All toolchain scripts have been created and made executable:
- ✅ `install-toolchain.sh` - Installs WIT tools (wit-bindgen-cli, wasm-tools, cargo-component)
- ✅ `validate-wit.sh` - Validates all WIT interface files
- ✅ `generate-bindings.sh` - Master script to generate all language bindings
- ✅ `generate-cpp.sh` - C++ binding generation
- ✅ `generate-go.sh` - Go binding generation
- ✅ `generate-typescript.sh` - TypeScript binding generation
- ✅ `generate-rust.sh` - Rust binding generation
- ✅ `test-bindings.sh` - Tests generated bindings

### 2. CI/CD Integration
- ✅ Created `.github/workflows/wit-validation.yml` for automated validation
- ✅ Configured to run on every WIT or script change
- ✅ Includes caching for faster builds
- ✅ Uploads generated bindings as artifacts

### 3. Documentation Updates
- ✅ Updated README.md with toolchain setup instructions
- ✅ Added development workflow documentation
- ✅ Included prerequisites and quick start guide

## ⚠️ Current Issue: WIT Syntax

The WIT files currently have syntax errors. The WIT parser is failing because:
1. Comments at the file start need proper formatting
2. The parser expects specific syntax that differs from our current files

### Example Error:
```
error: expected `(`
 --> wit/types/core.wit:1:1
  |
1 | // Core Memory Types - Fundamental abstractions
  | ^
```

## 🔧 Next Steps

To complete the toolchain setup:

1. **Fix WIT Syntax**: The WIT files need to be updated to use proper WIT syntax. Comments might need to use block comments `/* */` or be placed after the package declaration.

2. **Test Toolchain**: Once WIT files are fixed:
   ```bash
   # Validate WIT files
   ./scripts/validate-wit.sh
   
   # Generate bindings
   ./scripts/generate-bindings.sh
   
   # Test bindings
   ./scripts/test-bindings.sh
   ```

3. **Install Tools Locally**: Run the toolchain installer:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/install-toolchain.sh
   ```

## 📋 Task Summary

Per the task requirements in `002-setup-wit-toolchain.md`:

- ✅ **Tool Installation Scripts**: Complete
- ✅ **Build Script Architecture**: All scripts created
- ✅ **CI Integration**: GitHub Actions workflow ready
- ✅ **Documentation**: README updated
- ⚠️ **WIT Validation**: Blocked by syntax issues in WIT files
- ⏳ **Binding Generation**: Ready once WIT files are fixed

The WIT toolchain infrastructure is fully in place. Once the WIT files are updated with proper syntax, the entire pipeline will be operational.
