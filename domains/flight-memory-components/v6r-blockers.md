# V6R Blocking Dependencies on Flight Memory Components

## Executive Summary

V6R's mobile coding platform requires memory type definitions for tracking VM resources, enforcing limits, and providing real-time usage monitoring. The flight-memory-components library provides the foundational types and validation logic that v6r needs to implement safe, efficient memory management across their TypeScript and Go services.

## Critical Blockers

### 1. Memory Type Definitions (Week 1)
**What V6R Needs**: Core memory types that can be used in TypeScript and Go
**Blocked Features**:
- VM memory allocation tracking
- Session memory usage reporting  
- Memory limit enforcement
- Real-time usage updates via WebSocket

**Specific Requirements**:
```typescript
// V6R needs these types in TypeScript
interface MemorySize {
  bytes: number;
  humanReadable: string;  // "2MB", "512KB", etc.
}

interface MemoryUsageSnapshot {
  timestamp: number;
  sessionId: string;
  platform: string;
  total: MemorySize;
  used: MemorySize;
  available: MemorySize;
}
```

### 2. Platform Memory Profiles (Week 2)
**What V6R Needs**: Memory constraints for different VM configurations
**Blocked Features**:
- VM size selection (small/medium/large)
- Platform-appropriate memory limits
- Memory pressure warnings
- Resource exhaustion prevention

**Impact**: Without platform profiles, v6r cannot:
- Validate VM configuration requests
- Set appropriate resource limits
- Provide accurate capacity planning

### 3. Memory Validation Components (Week 2)
**What V6R Needs**: Runtime validation of memory operations
**Blocked Features**:
- Memory allocation request validation
- Resource limit enforcement
- Memory leak detection
- Usage pattern analysis

**Critical for**:
- Preventing VM resource exhaustion
- Ensuring fair resource allocation
- Detecting abnormal usage patterns

### 4. Language Bindings (Week 3)
**What V6R Needs**: Generated TypeScript and Go bindings
**Blocked Features**:
- Type-safe memory tracking in v6r-api (Go)
- Consistent types in v6r-mobile (TypeScript)
- Real-time memory updates in v6r-bridge
- Memory reporting in push notifications

## Dependency Timeline

```
Week 1: Core WIT Types
  └─> V6R can start defining memory tracking interfaces

Week 2: Platform Profiles & Validators  
  └─> V6R can implement VM resource management

Week 3: Language Bindings Generated
  └─> V6R can integrate types across all services

Week 4: Full Integration
  └─> V6R memory management fully operational
```

## Integration Points

### v6r-api (Go Service)
```go
import "github.com/flight-core/flight-memory-components/bindings/go"

// Track VM memory allocation
allocation := memory.MemoryAllocation{
    ID: uuid.New().String(),
    SessionID: session.ID,
    Size: memory.MemorySize{
        Bytes: 536870912, // 512MB
        HumanReadable: "512MB",
    },
    Purpose: memory.MemoryPurpose_VM_HEAP,
}
```

### v6r-mobile (React Native)
```typescript
import { MemoryUsageSnapshot } from '@flight/memory-components';

// Display memory usage in UI
const MemoryIndicator: React.FC<{ usage: MemoryUsageSnapshot }> = ({ usage }) => {
    const percentage = (usage.used.bytes / usage.total.bytes) * 100;
    return <ProgressBar value={percentage} color={getColorForUsage(percentage)} />;
};
```

### v6r-bridge (Golang Bridge)
```go
// Stream memory updates via WebSocket
func streamMemoryUpdates(session *Session) {
    ticker := time.NewTicker(5 * time.Second)
    for range ticker.C {
        snapshot := memory.GetUsageSnapshot(session.VMID)
        session.SendWebSocketMessage("memory_update", snapshot)
    }
}
```

## Risk Mitigation

### If Delayed
1. **Week 1-2**: V6R can use simplified internal types
2. **Week 2-3**: Mock validation logic locally
3. **Week 3+**: Must have real types for production

### Alternative Approaches
- V6R could define temporary types but risks divergence
- Could skip validation initially but risks resource exhaustion
- Could hardcode limits but loses platform flexibility

## Success Criteria

✅ V6R can track memory allocations per session
✅ Memory limits enforced across all VMs
✅ Real-time memory updates working
✅ Platform-appropriate resource allocation
✅ No memory type mismatches between services

## Action Items

1. [ ] Flight-memory team delivers core WIT types (Week 1)
2. [ ] V6R team reviews and provides feedback
3. [ ] Generate initial TypeScript/Go bindings
4. [ ] V6R implements memory tracking with types
5. [ ] Integration testing across services
6. [ ] Performance validation under load

**Critical Path**: V6R's VM resource management is completely blocked without these memory types. This is the #1 priority for enabling safe, production-ready VM orchestration.
